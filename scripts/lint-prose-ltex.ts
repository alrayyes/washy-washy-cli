/**
 * Runs ltex-cli-plus over the repo's prose, both from `pre-push` and from
 * CI's `ltex` job — the same script, so the two cannot drift.
 *
 * Installs into `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` (falling back to `~/.cache`), not
 * `.tools/`: the release is a ~300 MB archive shipping its own Java 21
 * runtime, too heavy to fetch fresh on every push the way `.tools/vale` does
 * for its own single binary. Once cached, a run over a handful of documents
 * is about ten seconds. CI gets the same benefit from `actions/cache`
 * wrapping this same directory, keyed on the pinned version below.
