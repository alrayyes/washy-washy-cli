# washy-washy

Reads `data/washy-washy.json` — appliances under `machine`, one row per pile
under `chart` — and renders six PDFs: a single tall page for the phone and an
A4 reference sheet plus detail cards for printing, each in three cuts —
everything, washing only, ironing only. Also writes one small card PDF per
pile (or shared-card group), for reprinting a single card without the rest of
the sheet. That file is gitignored — one household's laundry is nobody else's
business — so the committed config is `data/washy-washy.json.dist` and the
CLI falls back to it. Tests and CI read the `.dist`; never point them at the
other one.

## Commands

- `bun run generate` — write all six PDFs, plus one card PDF per pile, to `out/`
- `bun run new-config [path]` — scaffold a fresh config (placeholder machine,
  one placeholder pile); default path `data/washy-washy.json`. Refuses to
  overwrite an existing file
- `bun run validate-config [path]` — same validation `generate` does, without
  drawing anything; default path `data/washy-washy.json` (so a fresh clone
  with no file of your own validates the `.dist`)
- `bun run examples` — redraw the six PDFs under `docs/` that the README links,
  from the `.dist` config
- `docker build -t washy-washy . && docker run --rm -v "$PWD/out:/out" washy-washy`
  — the same thing without Bun on the host. CI builds and runs it too, so a
  `Dockerfile` that lints and does not work fails there; releases push it to GHCR
- `bun run check` — every linter, `tsc --noEmit` and the tests, in that order
- `bun run format` — Prettier over the Markdown and YAML; it owns those and nothing else
- `bun run prose:sync` — fetch Vale's style packages; needed once before `check` works
- `bun test test/config.test.ts` — one file, when iterating

## Gotchas

- **Only Helvetica is embedded**, so glyphs are limited to WinAnsi. `•`, `°`,
  `—`, `–` and `'` are safe; `≈`, `✓`, `→` and curly quotes silently drop out of
  the PDF. Check any new prose in the chart before committing it.
- **The phone page height is measured, not chosen.** `renderPhone` renders the
  document repeatedly and bisects until it fits on one page. Don't replace it
  with a constant — adding a sentence to the chart would push a card onto page two.
- **The appliances are data.** They're the `machine` key of `data/washy-washy.json`,
  and every programme, temperature, spin speed and button in the `chart` key
  is checked against them. The dial angles come from the order of
  `washer.programs`, so a reordered list redraws every card. Fascia labels are
  never translated — `parseMachine`/`parseConfig` in `@washy-washy/core`
  only validate; `loadConfig` in `src/config.ts` is the Bun-only
  file-reading adapter around them.
- **`data/machine.json.dist` outlived the old two-file config setup on
  purpose.** It's the shared `DIST_MACHINE` fixture several tests load for a
  realistic `Machine` — unrelated to the CLI's own input, which is
  `data/washy-washy.json`. Don't delete it as a leftover; check what imports
  `DIST_MACHINE` first. There's no schema or validator for it any more —
  it's a fixture, not a file anything else generates or checks.
- **This repo doesn't generate its own JSON Schema for the combined config.**
  `@washy-washy/core` does — `configToJson` leads its output with a
  `$schema` key (`CONFIG_SCHEMA_URL`) pointing at the published package's
  schema on jsDelivr. Duplicating schema generation here would split logic
  core already owns across two repos. `bun run validate-config` uses
  `parseConfig` for real semantic validation instead of walking that schema
  — the schema is for editor autocomplete, not a second source of truth.
- **Anything that writes a file for the repo must load `DIST_MACHINE`, not
  `DEFAULT_MACHINE`.** The latter prefers your own appliances, so the schema
  generator and the tests would otherwise bake in whatever machine the person
  running them happens to own.
- **`mixing.ts`, in `@washy-washy/core`, is the only place that decides what
  can share a drum.** The per-card "wash together with" line, the
  compatibility matrix and the CLI summary all read from it, so a rule
  change there lands in all three here at once next time the dependency
  bumps. It also owns how each sheet cuts the chart into cards: `cardGroups`
  for the full one, `washGroups` with the thermostat dropped, `ironGroups`
  with nothing else kept.
- **`@washy-washy/core` and `@washy-washy/pdf` are real npm dependencies,
  not a local workspace.** This repo, [washy-washy-web](https://github.com/alrayyes/washy-washy-web)
  and both packages' own repos are four separate repos, split out of what
  used to be one monorepo. Bumping either is an ordinary dependency update,
  pinned to an exact version like everything else. File I/O (`loadConfig`,
  `loadMachine`) stays in this repo; the packages only ever take file
  contents as a string or a parsed value.
- **A sheet is defined by what it leaves out**, so `test/generate.test.ts`
  inflates the content streams and reads the words back. Adding an iron word to
  the washing sheet fails there, not in review.
- **`biome.json` is strict JSON, not JSONC** — despite `tsconfig.json` and
  `.releaserc.json` tolerating comments elsewhere in this repo, a `//` in
  `biome.json` fails to parse and silently falls back to defaults, which then
  reformats every file in the repo (tabs instead of the configured spaces).
  Explain a rule choice in this file instead of inline there.

## Conventions

- The config is data, not code: adding a pile should never need a code change.
- Care advice is sourced. When you change a wash setting, say in the commit body
  why — the manufacturer, a care label, a test — not just that it seemed better.
- `out/` is generated. Never commit a PDF from it. The six under `docs/` are
  the exception — the README links them — and they are written by
  `bun run examples`, which names the `.dist` config, so your own appliances
  cannot get into them. A test in `test/generate.test.ts` fails while they are
  stale. `bun run examples` also drops the per-pile card PDFs into `docs/`,
  same as any other run — too many to showcase, so `.gitignore` excludes
  `docs/washy-washy-card-*.pdf` rather than growing the committed set.
