# Runs the generator without a bun on the host: mount a chart in, get PDFs out.
#
# Alpine, unlike the CI images, which need glibc for the prose linters. Nothing
# in the generator is a native binary — it is TypeScript, bun and pure-JS
# dependencies — so musl is no obstacle and the image stays small.

# Dependencies in their own stage, so the runtime image never sees a lockfile,
# a dev dependency or a package manager. --production drops Biome, Prettier,
# Vale and the rest: none of them have anything to do with drawing a PDF.
